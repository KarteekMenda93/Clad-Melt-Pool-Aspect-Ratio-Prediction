# Clad-Melt-Pool-Aspect-ratio-Prediction

A machine learning (ML) framework for prediction of metal additive manufacturing (MAM) trace characteristic and process optimization.

At present, physics numerical simulation and semi-empirical regression are the two accepted methods for predicting clad/melt pool geometry in metal additive manufacturing. This study proposes a novel approach through the use of machine learning techniques for predicting the characteristics of the clad and melt pool.

## Why prediction of aspect ratio
***Quality Control:*** Aspect ratio can be an indicator of the quality of the printed parts. Deviations from the desired aspect ratio may signal issues such as poor dimensional accuracy, layer misalignment, or insufficient material deposition.

***Process Optimization:*** Understanding how various process parameters affect the aspect ratio can help optimize the additive manufacturing process. By predicting the aspect ratio, researchers and engineers can identify optimal settings for parameters such as layer height, print speed, and material flow rate to achieve the desired aspect ratio.

***Design Considerations:*** The aspect ratio of a printed part may be a critical design parameter in some applications. For example, in structures like columns or beams, the aspect ratio can affect mechanical properties such as stiffness, strength, and load-bearing capacity. Predicting the aspect ratio allows designers to tailor their designs to meet specific performance requirements.

***Quality Assurance:*** Predicting the aspect ratio can serve as a quality assurance metric in additive manufacturing processes. By comparing predicted aspect ratios with target values, manufacturers can ensure that printed parts meet dimensional specifications and quality standards.

Overall, predicting the aspect ratio in additive manufacturing contributes to process understanding, quality control, and the optimization of printed parts for specific applications. It enables researchers and engineers to achieve better control over the manufacturing process and produce parts with desired geometrical and mechanical properties.

# Clad-Melt-Pool-Aspect-ratio-Prediction

A machine learning (ML) framework for prediction of metal additive manufacturing (MAM) trace characteristic and process optimization.

At present, physics numerical simulation and semi-empirical regression are the two accepted methods for predicting clad/melt pool geometry in metal additive manufacturing. This study proposes a novel approach through the use of machine learning techniques for predicting the characteristics of the clad and melt pool.
